# MelodicMind

With an ear for iconic styles, MelodicMind weaves together notes, improvising melodies reminiscent of the greats yet entirely its own. Harness the power of artificial intelligence to bring your musical improvisations to life. `MelodicMind` seeks to understand and replicate the unique improvisational styles of renowned musicians across various instruments, giving budding artists a revolutionary tool to elevate their craft.

## Introduction

The art of musical improvisation has always been a testament to an artist's unique voice and style. By analyzing historic recordings from a range of artists and instruments, `MelodicMind` aims to be a bridge between tradition and modernity, offering musicians a platform to generate improvisations that capture the spirit of iconic styles.

## Features (Planned)

1. **Style Embeddings**: Dive deep into the stylistic nuances that define each musician, from rhythmic patterns to note choices.
2. **Temporal Modeling**: Understand and replicate the significance of timing, rhythm, and dynamics in improvisation.
3. **Interactive API**: A real-time interface for musicians to generate improvisations on the fly, adapting to input melodies or chord progressions.
4. **Community Contributions**: Collaborate, share, and expand our database of improvisational styles from diverse artists and instruments.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Provide real-time feedback, allowing the system to learn and improve over time.

## Getting Started

As the project is in its initial phase, we're actively seeking contributions and feedback. 

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/avilesg/MelodicMind.git`
2. **Setup**: [TODO: basic setup guide or link to detailed instructions.]
3. **Contribute**: Check out our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and our open [issues](https://github.com/avilesg/MelodicMind/issues).

## Contribution Guide

We believe that the essence of music transcends boundaries and genres. Whether you're a jazz pianist or a rock guitarist, your unique style adds value. Contribute samples, provide feedback, or help refine our algorithms.

1. **Sample Contributions**: Share recordings that embody distinct improvisational styles. Ensure clear metadata about the artist and instrument.
2. **Algorithm Enhancement**: If you're familiar with AI and have ideas to improve our model, we'd love to collaborate.
3. **Documentation**: Help us maintain clear and concise documentation to assist new contributors.
